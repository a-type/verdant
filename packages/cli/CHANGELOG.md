## 4.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 6cfa90d: Complete refactor of server to support more runtimes. This fundamentally changes how Verdant server is constructed and used in Node, and adds a Cloudflare binding.

  ## Breaking changes

  - New, rewritten Node bindings and initialization procedure. See docs.
  - **Removed:** Unified SQL storage. Only sharded SQLite storage is supported.
  - How Node sync servers interact with libraries has changed. See docs.

  ## Internal changes

  These shouldn't affect user code but do require updating client/server in tandem.

  - Heartbeat payload is simplified to just `type`.

  ## New: Cloudflare

  Verdant now has experimental support for Cloudflare stacks, using Durable Objects to represent individual Verdant libraries.

  This always seemed like a good fit, but the effort of refactoring required to adapt to a very different backend architecture meant it's been a long time coming.

  Cloudflare bindings pass the same extensive integration test suite as the original Node bindings, 1:1. This gives some real confidence in stability, but for the time being they remain `0.1` until proven in production.

  ## Other things

  The main integration test suite has been rewritten from JSDOM and now uses Vitest Browser Mode, to provide even more reliability that Verdant works in real browsers. The tests are also faster now!

## 4.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 8db254a: Fix typings of lists with recursive field items

## 4.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 7b24c33: Support for recursive field definitions

## 4.8.0

### Minor Changes

- cb886d5: [CLI] Fixed named type generation for File fields; was "string", now "EntityFile." Fixed named type generation for nullable fields; previously named types would include `| null` union, now they only describe the defined shape and the `| null` is properly applied to Init/Destructured parent objects to specify when a null value is allowed or expected. The named types should now be more helpful for describing the actual defined value of the field in question!

## 4.7.3

### Patch Changes

- ef5fa50: New Store feature: query keep-alives. Keep a query in memory based on its `key`. Also new in CLI, the Client is now generated with more JSDocs applied, and exposes the .queries property required to use the keep-alive feature.

## 4.7.2

### Patch Changes

- cacc5b0: Adds typings for new useWatch option to disable usage tracking

## 4.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 21357127: fix cli old schemas index generation. fix WIP crash.

## 4.7.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- 21357127: fix cli old schemas index generation. fix WIP crash.

## 4.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 1787ef97: Official release of refactored persistence layer! This doesn't have much functional impact for users, but some advanced/experimental config settings have changed. Store now requires a recently generated client via CLI; be sure to upgrade CLI and regenerate your client from your schema even if your schema hasn't changed.

### Patch Changes

- 423493cf: Major internal refactoring of persistence layer. Verdant still only supports IndexedDB for now, but this is a huge step toward configurable storage. Prereleasing this version to test in real-world environments.

## 4.6.2-next.0

### Patch Changes

- 423493cf: Major internal refactoring of persistence layer. Verdant still only supports IndexedDB for now, but this is a huge step toward configurable storage. Prereleasing this version to test in real-world environments.

## 4.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 729a908e: You can now pass a "documentation" property to schema fields to attach a doc string to the generated typing.

## 4.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 31f59a77: ## Store

  Adds built-in presence features for field presence. Use `setFieldId` to track presence on a field. If using directly, you must decide on a field ID for the field. See React docs for more seamless integration with `useField`.

  ## React

  Adds the `useField` hook. Pass an entity and a key and it gives you a grab bag of all the stuff you need to work with a particular field. See docs for more info.

  ## Common

  Adds the 'id' field type as a shorthand for string type with an id generated default

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4679a9fb: Authorized document access full release
- 5882e6dc: Introduces document access control. It's now possible to mark specific documents as 'private,' which restricts access of these documents to only the current user's devices in sync scenarios. Access controls have no effect on local-only databases, but are still advised for use since these libraries might sync someday in the future. See the docs for information on how to assign access control and caveats about usage.

## 4.5.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

See the docs for information on how to assign access control and caveats about usage.

## 4.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 274e047: Support supplying old schemas to client, and make CLI generate code to do this. This doesn't do anything yet!

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c701cfd: Add React hook "useOnChange" (fires a callback on entity changes). Add "deep" option to React hook "useWatch" to watch for deep changes. Remove the "field" variant of "useWatch." CLI must be updated to correctly generate new React hook types.

## 4.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 4daf1b0: CLI support for new react hooks options

## 4.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d5ca12f: Fix generated react hook mutations typings

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4077465: This release officially removes support for "indexed" applied to individual fields in your schema. Please migrate to use the "indexes" section of the collection definition instead! It also fixes some typing issues with the new field creator functions on schema.fields.

## 4.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 8b004bd: _New!_ Schema helpers to replace old type-restricted schema objects. Utilize the helpers to get better intellisense and more helpful TS validation in your schema.

  ```ts
  import { schema } from '@verdant-web/store';

  const items = schema.collection({
  	name: 'item',
  	primaryKey: 'id',
  	fields: {
  		id: schema.fields.string({ default: schema.generated.id }),
  		obj: schema.object({
  			properties: {
  				name: schema.fields.string(),
  				value: schema.fields.number(),
  			},
  			default: {
  				name: 'hello',
  				value: 1,
  			},
  		}),
  	},
  });

  export default schema({
  	version: 1,
  	collections: {
  		items,
  	},
  });
  ```

  They may be a little more verbose, but using these wrappers is essential to adding better type validation and other potential features down the line (like typed `any` fields).

  Also, `object` field now accepts default. Object defaults recursively apply nested field defaults if present.

## 4.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 398452d: Fix CLI for older node versions hanging on schema read

## 4.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f16fe63: Fix some typing issues in the CLI

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ba63e80: # Summary

  Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning" and more advanced document validation.

  ## Breaking changes

  - Supplying invalid data to documents (according to the schema) is no longer ignored and throws an error.
  - Documents with data which doesn't conform to schema now "prune" invalid data up to the nearest nullable parent or array/map collection. If no prune point is found, the entire document is unavailable.
  - Removed `client.entities.flushPatches`; use `client.entities.flushAllBatches` instead to write all pending changes to storage and sync.

  ## Ambiguous changes

  - `changeDeep` event on documents now fires before `change`
  - Document entities will be garbage collected more reliably now. Storing references to entities outside of a query is not recommended. This behavior requires the `EXPERIMENTAL_weakRefs` flag to be provided to the client initializer.

## 4.2.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning."

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 594a03c: Support limited options for string fields in schema and CLI. Adds validation for field values when writing to entities.

### Patch Changes

- 78d2fdf: Allow more non-interactive CLI selections
- fef825e: Fix CLI not bumping WIP schema to prod schema

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 6cab5a4: Server: delete empty snapshots and don't store new empty snapshots. This shouldn't have any effect on behavior. Client: fixed a rare bug with initializing a client for the first time. CLI: fixed typings for deletable fields.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 4309702: Fix filter typings for array indexes

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 6b65690: Fix CLI upgrade writing to canonical schema

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 85e34fe: Fix another compound index problem with the CLI
- 1db7857: Fix CLI always wanting to upgrade

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- be96681: Fix error with upgrading migrations from older CLI versions
- 465f400: Fix validation problem with compound indexes
- 15ad587: Fix generated migration typings

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- a73d381: Rewrites the CLI to fully evaluate schema code, rather than just parsing it as a Typescript AST.

  This allows schemas to import other modules and use any plain TS logic desired to define the final schema.

  Schemas are now bundled and compiled to JS before storing historical copies. The primary schema is now just a pointer to its historical version.

  Migrations now use the new `createMigration` function universally. Migrations are now generated with typings supplied by compiled historical schemas. This should make migration typings more consistent and reliable.

  This change also deprecates fields with `index: true` in favor of a new `indexes` part of a collection schema, which allows direct field pass-through indexes. This consolidates indexes in one place (or, two, with compounds...) and generally makes the typing simpler.

  Deleted a lot of extraneous TS typings.

  Store now only writes index values as top-level fields in the object written to IndexedDB. A snapshot of the object is still provided in a sub-key for future use. This should not be a noticeable change; Verdant had already phased out using the snapshot value in favor of regenerating the view from operations on first load of a document.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 81ca170: **Major CLI changes**:

  - The CLI now supports BETA WIP schema workflows. WIP schemas allow you to iterate on schema design locally more easily by copying your database into a temporary branch while you tune the new schema and automatically resetting it when the schema changes.
  - A new CLI command has been added: `verdant-preflight`. Include this in your CI to validate that the current schema is not WIP and ready for deployment before merging and deploying your app. Deploying a WIP schema can cause major problems for users, including data loss.
  - _Migration:_ CLI usage hasn't changed too much, but the workflow has. You'll see when you run it. It's more interactive now; no need to pass additional flags like `--force`.

  Store changes:

  - Store now supports WIP schemas. Supplying a schema with `wip: true` to the StoreDescriptor will initialize a Store with the WIP schema and copy all data from the main databases into temporary fork databases for that schema. You can then test your app with the schema changes before committing to a particular schema shape.
  - WIP schema usage disables sync! This prevents ephemeral data from being stored on the server or passed to other clients. Commit your WIP schema changes into a production schema to re-enable sync.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a8f0f2: Add typings for client events

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a8c8c09: New migration features: shortcut migrations, auto-migration

  ## Shortcut migrations

  You can skip versions when creating migrations, effectively deprecating ranges of versions which you believe no existing clients utilize anymore. This should be done with care!

  You can also use shortcut migrations to create a parallel path from one version to another which skips intermediate versions, reducing the number of migrations new clients have to make to reach the current version.

  See the [docs](https://verdant.dev/docs/local-storage/migrations) for more!

  ## Auto-migration

  Schema migrations now automatically apply simple changes without you having to write any migration logic. Changes supported are:

  - Adding indexes
  - Changing indexes
  - Removing indexes
  - Adding default values to fields or sub-fields
  - Removing fields or sub-fields

  If your schema changes fall within these categories, you don't have to write any migration logic! Just leave the generated file in-place.

## 2.0.1

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9219d68: New queries, including paginated queries.

  # Breaking changes & migration

  You must move any index filters passed to `findOne` or `findAll` into an `index` property in the passed object parameter.

  # What's changed under the hood

  The query system has been revamped to allow for pagination, more intentional caching, and lazy-loading results.

  For the most part, existing `get`, `findOne`, and `findAll` queries work the same as before. However, note that they will not longer eagerly fetch results on creation; you must access `.resolved` or call `.subscribe` to trigger the initial query.

  # New features

  There are two new queries, `getAllInfinite` and `getPage`, which load paginated subsets of the results. You can read about how to use these new queries in the docs.

  This is a major version change for `web` because of the `index` field change, and lazy-loading may cause unforeseen issues in existing codebases. Please upgrade and test functionality carefully. `cli` has also been major-bumped to go along with `web` since it now generates code that relies on `web`'s new functionality.
