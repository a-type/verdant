## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- fe020adb: Add "internal" presence concepts which use presence machinery to power built-in features. Starting with "view ID" which encodes the 'view' the user is looking at, further refining presence peer relationships for apps with multiple distinct views. This version also adds a cleanup callback to the router's route onVisited callback.

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- ba63e80: # Summary

  Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning" and more advanced document validation.

  ## Breaking changes

  - Supplying invalid data to documents (according to the schema) is no longer ignored and throws an error.
  - Documents with data which doesn't conform to schema now "prune" invalid data up to the nearest nullable parent or array/map collection. If no prune point is found, the entire document is unavailable.
  - Removed `client.entities.flushPatches`; use `client.entities.flushAllBatches` instead to write all pending changes to storage and sync.

  ## Ambiguous changes

  - `changeDeep` event on documents now fires before `change`
  - Document entities will be garbage collected more reliably now. Storing references to entities outside of a query is not recommended. This behavior requires the `EXPERIMENTAL_weakRefs` flag to be provided to the client initializer.

### Minor Changes

- 2494e71: Breaking change to router: [perf] remove onAccessible callback in routes

  This feature was simply bad for performance and scalability as the number of routes grew, since each Link had to traverse the entire route tree on mount. This created an exponential slowdown between number of links on the page and number of routes.

  If you want to preload data for routes the user may visit from the current page, use `onVisited` on that page and your own judgment on what to preload.
