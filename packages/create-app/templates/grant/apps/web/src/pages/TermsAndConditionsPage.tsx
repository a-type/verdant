				Services by users or anyone else (“Content”) or on websites that link
				to, or are linked from, our Services. We're not responsible for any use
				or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:
			</P>

			<ul>
				<li>
					A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that
					we endorse any third-party website.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don't endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate,
					useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or
					objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes,
					or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights,
					intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third
					parties.
				</li>
				<li>
					You're fully responsible for the Content available in your account,
					and any harm resulting form that Content. It's your responsibility to
					ensure any Content abides by applicable laws and the Agreement
				</li>
				<li>
					We aren't responsible for any harm resulting from anyone's access,
					use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting
					from third-party websites. You're responsible for taking the necessary
					precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from
					viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
					content.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<H2>Fees, Payment, and Renewal</H2>

			<P>
				<strong>Fees for Paid Services</strong> Some of our Services are offered
				for a fee, like synchronization between devices, and collaborative
				lists. This section applies to any purchases of Paid Services.
			</P>
			<P>
				By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, in the
				form of recurring fees (subscriptions). Your subscription begins on your
				purchase date, and we'll bill or charge you in the
				automatically-renewing monthly interval (or other interval specified by
				us) until you cancel your subscription. You can cancel your subscription
				at any time by visiting your account settings.
			</P>
			<P>
				<strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless
				explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal,
				provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods
				and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (“Taxes”).
				You're responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use
				of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we're obligated to
				pay or collect Taxes on the fees you've paid or will pay, you're
				responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment from you.
			</P>
			<P>
				<strong>Payment</strong> You must provide accurate and up-to-date
				payment information. By providing your payment information, you
				authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment
				fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or
				paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card
				company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), we
				may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without
				notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated payment
				information provided by your bank or payment service provider (e.g., new
				expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we can't charge
				your primary payment method.
			</P>
			<P>
				<strong>Automatic Renewal</strong> By enrolling in a subscription, you
				authorize us to automatically charge the then-applicable fees and Taxes
				for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription is
				canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or subscribed
				during a free trial or promotion, your subscription will automatically
				renew for the full price of the subscription at the end of the discount
				period. This means that unless you cancel a subscription, it'll
				automatically renew and we'll charge your payment method(s). You must
				cancel at least one month before the scheduled end date of any annual
				subscription and at least 24 hours before the end of any shorter
				subscription period. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the
				date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you've purchased
				access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.
			</P>
			<P>
				You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in
				your settings.
			</P>
			<P>
				<strong>Fees and Changes</strong> We may change our fees at any time in
				accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This
				means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for
				Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or
				functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don't
				agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.
			</P>

			<H2>Feedback</H2>

			<P>
				We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services.
				When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that
				we're free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.
			</P>

				of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not
				waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.
