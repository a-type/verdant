# @lo-fi/web

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c793e54: Major but non-breaking changes to the diffing algorithm. Some undefined behaviors may be different when using `.update`, or during collection migrations. But all of those behaviors were bad or confusing before, and now they make a little more sense.

  # Store changes

  You can now use the `getEntityClient` exported function to retrieve the Client instance which owns any Verdant entity. I don't necessarily recommend using this much, but you might find it convenient as an alternative to `useClient`.

  # TipTap changes

  This version also fixes the TipTap integration's Undo behavior when deleting nodes, which previously caused invalid data. It changes the approach of the library by exposing a TipTap Extension for Verdant integration instead of relying on React.

  This integration also now allows you to switch between TipTap or Verdant's undo tracking as you see fit.

  See [docs](https://verdant.dev/docs/integrations/tiptap)

## 3.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 31f59a77: ## Store

  Adds built-in presence features for field presence. Use `setFieldId` to track presence on a field. If using directly, you must decide on a field ID for the field. See React docs for more seamless integration with `useField`.

  ## React

  Adds the `useField` hook. Pass an entity and a key and it gives you a grab bag of all the stuff you need to work with a particular field. See docs for more info.

  ## Common

  Adds the 'id' field type as a shorthand for string type with an id generated default

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [31f59a77]
  - @verdant-web/common@2.5.1

## 3.10.0

### Minor Changes

- fe020adb: Add "internal" presence concepts which use presence machinery to power built-in features. Starting with "view ID" which encodes the 'view' the user is looking at, further refining presence peer relationships for apps with multiple distinct views. This version also adds a cleanup callback to the router's route onVisited callback.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c9a0183]
  - @verdant-web/common@2.3.3

## 3.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c2a3c78: Fixed some big performance gaps in React hooks - query hooks no longer refresh queries on each render! Also dramatically reduced the number of times a query emits 'change' events to match only changes in the identities of returned documents, as designed, by fixing a mistake in change notification logic. Combined, these drastically improve performance in apps with frequent or real-time changes!
- 91a6a64: Add operation "overlaying," which compresses multiple batched changes to the same field into a single operation before persisting to storage and sync. This preserves the instantaneous nature of immediate changes, while also improving storage and network efficiency by not flushing every instantaneous operation to sync.

### Patch Changes

- e202bdd: Don't add set operations if the value hasn't changed. Add ListEntity.reduce.
- Updated dependencies [91a6a64]
  - @verdant-web/common@2.3.2

## 3.6.4

### Patch Changes

- 73e8c1b: Add entity features to enable multi-namespace use cases: access to parent namespace value, and self-delete method.

## 3.6.3

### Patch Changes

- c701cfd: Add React hook "useOnChange" (fires a callback on entity changes). Add "deep" option to React hook "useWatch" to watch for deep changes. Remove the "field" variant of "useWatch." CLI must be updated to correctly generate new React hook types.

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e7598d2: Bugfix: map-type entities were returning raw default values for missing keys
  Feature: `getOrSet` on entities allows providing an inline default to initialize an empty field synchronously

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 43edd7a: **Migration of server code required**

  Introduces support for custom server storage solutions via interface implementation. This change also makes server storage queries and writes async (they weren't before), which improves compatibility with custom solutions and performance overall with high message concurrency.

  ## Server migration

  Previously, you'd create a new Verdant server like so:

  ```ts
  new VerdantServer({
  	databaseFile: './path/to/db.sqlite',
  });
  ```

  Now, you should import `sqlStorage` from `@verdant-web/server/storage` and provide it to the `storage` parameter:

  ```ts
  new VerdantServer({
  	storage: sqlStorage({
  		databaseFile: './path/to/db.sqlite',
  	}),
  });
  ```

  That's all that's needed. Remember to also upgrade your client to handle some small tweaks to sync protocols. They should be non-breaking, but it's better to be safe here.

### Minor Changes

- 5fef280: # Support for full export/import of client data

  `Client.export` now returns an object with the full operation history, and now also data for all files and the downloaded files themselves.

  This can be used to create a backup ZIP file with the new `@verdant-web/store/backup` export. This is exported separately so that applications which don't need this functionality can reduce bundle size, as it comes with a full ZIP implementation.

  `Client.import` accepts the exact data that `Client.export` produces, allowing you to transfer data from one client to another. As a convenience for resolving disasters, `Client.__dangerous__hardReset` has been added, which exports and imports in-place, completely rewriting all local data. This may resolve issues in the wild with local database corruption should that happen again (God forbid).

### Major Changes

- ba63e80: # Summary

  Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning" and more advanced document validation.

  ## Breaking changes

  - Supplying invalid data to documents (according to the schema) is no longer ignored and throws an error.
  - Documents with data which doesn't conform to schema now "prune" invalid data up to the nearest nullable parent or array/map collection. If no prune point is found, the entire document is unavailable.
  - Removed `client.entities.flushPatches`; use `client.entities.flushAllBatches` instead to write all pending changes to storage and sync.

  ## Ambiguous changes

  - `changeDeep` event on documents now fires before `change`
  - Document entities will be garbage collected more reliably now. Storing references to entities outside of a query is not recommended. This behavior requires the `EXPERIMENTAL_weakRefs` flag to be provided to the client initializer.

### Patch Changes

- b0c78bf: ⚠️⚠️ This version requires updating the client and server simultaneously if your app still has legacy OIDs applied to documents. Hopefully that just means me. Does anyone else use Verdant? Anyway, this one removes those legacy OIDs completely so I don't have to worry about them anymore.

  Sorry for not really being semver-conscious here, but I really doubt it affects anyone at this point. You'd have to have been using Verdant before May 26, 2023 for this to matter to you.

  - @verdant-web/common@1.15.1

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 64e411b: Updated how plural names are used in collections. If you've named your collection keys as the plural, this won't affect you. However, if your collections were keyed by something that didn't match with your plural name, the names of the keys you use to access queries and of your generated React hooks will change.

  To migrate, remove all `pluralName` usage in your schema, and assign your collections to the plural name of your model in the `collections` part of your schema.

- a73d381: Rewrites the CLI to fully evaluate schema code, rather than just parsing it as a Typescript AST.

  This allows schemas to import other modules and use any plain TS logic desired to define the final schema.

  Schemas are now bundled and compiled to JS before storing historical copies. The primary schema is now just a pointer to its historical version.

  Migrations now use the new `createMigration` function universally. Migrations are now generated with typings supplied by compiled historical schemas. This should make migration typings more consistent and reliable.

  This change also deprecates fields with `index: true` in favor of a new `indexes` part of a collection schema, which allows direct field pass-through indexes. This consolidates indexes in one place (or, two, with compounds...) and generally makes the typing simpler.

  Deleted a lot of extraneous TS typings.

  Store now only writes index values as top-level fields in the object written to IndexedDB. A snapshot of the object is still provided in a sub-key for future use. This should not be a noticeable change; Verdant had already phased out using the snapshot value in favor of regenerating the view from operations on first load of a document.

### Patch Changes

- e6ac22a: Attempting to modify the primary key of a document now throws an error
- ab178e2: Fix a serious bug with deleting documents whose IDs are substrings of other document IDs
- 6dab424: Added an EXPERIMENTAL_weakRefs flag to client initialization which turns on WeakRef usage for all entities in cache. This helps to evict unused entities from memory safely. However, while it passes the full (extensive) Verdant test suite, I still want to test this in real life for a while before making it the default.
- Updated dependencies [a73d381]
  - @verdant-web/common@1.15.0

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 81ca170: **Major CLI changes**:

  - The CLI now supports BETA WIP schema workflows. WIP schemas allow you to iterate on schema design locally more easily by copying your database into a temporary branch while you tune the new schema and automatically resetting it when the schema changes.
  - A new CLI command has been added: `verdant-preflight`. Include this in your CI to validate that the current schema is not WIP and ready for deployment before merging and deploying your app. Deploying a WIP schema can cause major problems for users, including data loss.
  - _Migration:_ CLI usage hasn't changed too much, but the workflow has. You'll see when you run it. It's more interactive now; no need to pass additional flags like `--force`.

  Store changes:

  - Store now supports WIP schemas. Supplying a schema with `wip: true` to the StoreDescriptor will initialize a Store with the WIP schema and copy all data from the main databases into temporary fork databases for that schema. You can then test your app with the schema changes before committing to a particular schema shape.
  - WIP schema usage disables sync! This prevents ephemeral data from being stored on the server or passed to other clients. Commit your WIP schema changes into a production schema to re-enable sync.

### Patch Changes

- 3b2ee59: An attempt to fix a particularly nasty storage bug where a race condition caused some documents to soft-delete. Their operations were still present in metadata, but the queryable snapshot was written as a deletion because the snapshot writer accessed that metadata before it was ready. I can't guarantee this fixes all issues, but it reliably passes the regression test so far.

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [fd55c1b]
  - @verdant-web/common@1.13.4

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1429bfb: Verdant's client no longer applies changes from _future versions of your schema_ to local data. These changes are still stored and synced, but they will not be reflected in the application. This change is necessary to ensure data integrity with the code that's actually running on your device-- if a future schema changes the shape of the data, but the current client doesn't have that change yet, any data that reflects those changes could be reshaped and violate the expected types in the older code.

  This is technically a breaking change but I would hope nobody is relying on that behavior for some reason.

  I've added an event you can subscribe to on the client called `futureSeen`. If the client notices a change from a future version of the app, it will fire this event. You can subscribe to it to prompt the user to reload the page and get the latest code. Otherwise, in a realtime scenario, they simply won't see the changes the other client is making.

### Minor Changes

- a8c8c09: New migration features: shortcut migrations, auto-migration

  ## Shortcut migrations

  You can skip versions when creating migrations, effectively deprecating ranges of versions which you believe no existing clients utilize anymore. This should be done with care!

  You can also use shortcut migrations to create a parallel path from one version to another which skips intermediate versions, reducing the number of migrations new clients have to make to reach the current version.

  See the [docs](https://verdant.dev/docs/local-storage/migrations) for more!

  ## Auto-migration

  Schema migrations now automatically apply simple changes without you having to write any migration logic. Changes supported are:

  - Adding indexes
  - Changing indexes
  - Removing indexes
  - Adding default values to fields or sub-fields
  - Removing fields or sub-fields

  If your schema changes fall within these categories, you don't have to write any migration logic! Just leave the generated file in-place.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9219d68: New queries, including paginated queries.

  # Breaking changes & migration

  You must move any index filters passed to `findOne` or `findAll` into an `index` property in the passed object parameter.

  # What's changed under the hood

  The query system has been revamped to allow for pagination, more intentional caching, and lazy-loading results.

  For the most part, existing `get`, `findOne`, and `findAll` queries work the same as before. However, note that they will not longer eagerly fetch results on creation; you must access `.resolved` or call `.subscribe` to trigger the initial query.

  # New features

  There are two new queries, `getAllInfinite` and `getPage`, which load paginated subsets of the results. You can read about how to use these new queries in the docs.

  This is a major version change for `web` because of the `index` field change, and lazy-loading may cause unforeseen issues in existing codebases. Please upgrade and test functionality carefully. `cli` has also been major-bumped to go along with `web` since it now generates code that relies on `web`'s new functionality.
