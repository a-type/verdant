# @lo-fi/server

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6cfa90d: Complete refactor of server to support more runtimes. This fundamentally changes how Verdant server is constructed and used in Node, and adds a Cloudflare binding.

  ## Breaking changes

  - New, rewritten Node bindings and initialization procedure. See docs.
  - **Removed:** Unified SQL storage. Only sharded SQLite storage is supported.
  - How Node sync servers interact with libraries has changed. See docs.

  ## Internal changes

  These shouldn't affect user code but do require updating client/server in tandem.

  - Heartbeat payload is simplified to just `type`.

  ## New: Cloudflare

  Verdant now has experimental support for Cloudflare stacks, using Durable Objects to represent individual Verdant libraries.

  This always seemed like a good fit, but the effort of refactoring required to adapt to a very different backend architecture meant it's been a long time coming.

  Cloudflare bindings pass the same extensive integration test suite as the original Node bindings, 1:1. This gives some real confidence in stability, but for the time being they remain `0.1` until proven in production.

  ## Other things

  The main integration test suite has been rewritten from JSDOM and now uses Vitest Browser Mode, to provide even more reliability that Verdant works in real browsers. The tests are also faster now!

It's now possible to mark specific documents as 'private,' which restricts access of these documents to only the current user's devices in sync scenarios. Access controls have no effect on local-only databases, but are still advised for use since these libraries might sync someday in the future. See the docs for information on how to assign access control and caveats about usage.

### Major Changes

- 43edd7a: **Migration of server code required**

  Introduces support for custom server storage solutions via interface implementation. This change also makes server storage queries and writes async (they weren't before), which improves compatibility with custom solutions and performance overall with high message concurrency.

  ## Server migration

  Previously, you'd create a new Verdant server like so:

  ```ts
  new VerdantServer({
  	databaseFile: './path/to/db.sqlite',
  });
  ```

  Now, you should import `sqlStorage` from `@verdant-web/server/storage` and provide it to the `storage` parameter:

  ```ts
  new VerdantServer({
  	storage: sqlStorage({
  		databaseFile: './path/to/db.sqlite',
  	}),
  });
  ```

  That's all that's needed. Remember to also upgrade your client to handle some small tweaks to sync protocols. They should be non-breaking, but it's better to be safe here.

## 2.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 8b004bd: _New!_ Schema helpers to replace old type-restricted schema objects. Utilize the helpers to get better intellisense and more helpful TS validation in your schema.

  ```ts
  import { schema } from '@verdant-web/store';

  const items = schema.collection({
  	name: 'item',
  	primaryKey: 'id',
  	fields: {
  		id: schema.fields.string({ default: schema.generated.id }),
  		obj: schema.object({
  			properties: {
  				name: schema.fields.string(),
  				value: schema.fields.number(),
  			},
  			default: {
  				name: 'hello',
  				value: 1,
  			},
  		}),
  	},
  });

  export default schema({
  	version: 1,
  	collections: {
  		items,
  	},
  });
  ```

  They may be a little more verbose, but using these wrappers is essential to adding better type validation and other potential features down the line (like typed `any` fields).

  Also, `object` field now accepts default. Object defaults recursively apply nested field defaults if present.

### Major Changes

- ba63e80: # Summary

  Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning" and more advanced document validation.

  ## Breaking changes

  - Supplying invalid data to documents (according to the schema) is no longer ignored and throws an error.
  - Documents with data which doesn't conform to schema now "prune" invalid data up to the nearest nullable parent or array/map collection. If no prune point is found, the entire document is unavailable.
  - Removed `client.entities.flushPatches`; use `client.entities.flushAllBatches` instead to write all pending changes to storage and sync.

  ## Ambiguous changes

  - `changeDeep` event on documents now fires before `change`
  - Document entities will be garbage collected more reliably now. Storing references to entities outside of a query is not recommended. This behavior requires the `EXPERIMENTAL_weakRefs` flag to be provided to the client initializer.

  Sorry for not really being semver-conscious here, but I really doubt it affects anyone at this point. You'd have to have been using Verdant before May 26, 2023 for this to matter to you.
