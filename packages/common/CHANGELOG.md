## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 9e863cc: Support lazy initialization of nested field helpers so they can self-refer

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b5d15631: Beginning of support for alternative persistence implementations. This involves major internal refactoring and some undocumented internal-use-only library API changes.

## 2.7.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- b5d15631: Beginning of support for alternative persistence implementations. This involves major internal refactoring and some undocumented internal-use-only library API changes.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 423493cf: Major internal refactoring of persistence layer. Verdant still only supports IndexedDB for now, but this is a huge step toward configurable storage. Prereleasing this version to test in real-world environments.
- 1787ef97: Official release of refactored persistence layer! This doesn't have much functional impact for users, but some advanced/experimental config settings have changed. Store now requires a recently generated client via CLI; be sure to upgrade CLI and regenerate your client from your schema even if your schema hasn't changed.

### Patch Changes

## 2.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 729a908e: You can now pass a "documentation" property to schema fields to attach a doc string to the generated typing.

## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 31f59a77: ## Store

  Adds built-in presence features for field presence. Use `setFieldId` to track presence on a field. If using directly, you must decide on a field ID for the field. See React docs for more seamless integration with `useField`.

  ## React

  Adds the `useField` hook. Pass an entity and a key and it gives you a grab bag of all the stuff you need to work with a particular field. See docs for more info.

  ## Common

  Adds the 'id' field type as a shorthand for string type with an id generated default

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- fe020adb: Add "internal" presence concepts which use presence machinery to power built-in features. Starting with "view ID" which encodes the 'view' the user is looking at, further refining presence peer relationships for apps with multiple distinct views. This version also adds a cleanup callback to the router's route onVisited callback.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 4679a9fb: Authorized document access full release
- 5882e6dc: Introduces document access control. It's now possible to mark specific documents as 'private,' which restricts access of these documents to only the current user's devices in sync scenarios. Access controls have no effect on local-only databases, but are still advised for use since these libraries might sync someday in the future. See the docs for information on how to assign access control and caveats about usage.

### Patch Changes

- 91ab8cd7: isomorphic base64 encoding

## 2.3.4

### Patch Changes

- d876471: Throttle presence updates over http sync to reduce http requests

## 2.3.3

### Patch Changes

- c9a0183: Putting a new document now ignores keys not included in the schema. Putting a new document also now properly validates incoming data against the schema and errors on data of the wrong type.

## 2.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 91a6a64: Add operation "overlaying," which compresses multiple batched changes to the same field into a single operation before persisting to storage and sync. This preserves the instantaneous nature of immediate changes, while also improving storage and network efficiency by not flushing every instantaneous operation to sync.

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 1ab35f2: Make broadcast channel namespace-specific

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 43edd7a: **Migration of server code required**

  Introduces support for custom server storage solutions via interface implementation. This change also makes server storage queries and writes async (they weren't before), which improves compatibility with custom solutions and performance overall with high message concurrency.

  ## Server migration

  Previously, you'd create a new Verdant server like so:

  ```ts
  new VerdantServer({
  	databaseFile: './path/to/db.sqlite',
  });
  ```

  Now, you should import `sqlStorage` from `@verdant-web/server/storage` and provide it to the `storage` parameter:

  ```ts
  new VerdantServer({
  	storage: sqlStorage({
  		databaseFile: './path/to/db.sqlite',
  	}),
  });
  ```

  That's all that's needed. Remember to also upgrade your client to handle some small tweaks to sync protocols. They should be non-breaking, but it's better to be safe here.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4077465: This release officially removes support for "indexed" applied to individual fields in your schema. Please migrate to use the "indexes" section of the collection definition instead! It also fixes some typing issues with the new field creator functions on schema.fields.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e4f0720: Fix bug with presence not having a local replica id

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b004bd: _New!_ Schema helpers to replace old type-restricted schema objects. Utilize the helpers to get better intellisense and more helpful TS validation in your schema.

  ```ts
  import { schema } from '@verdant-web/store';

  const items = schema.collection({
  	name: 'item',
  	primaryKey: 'id',
  	fields: {
  		id: schema.fields.string({ default: schema.generated.id }),
  		obj: schema.object({
  			properties: {
  				name: schema.fields.string(),
  				value: schema.fields.number(),
  			},
  			default: {
  				name: 'hello',
  				value: 1,
  			},
  		}),
  	},
  });

  export default schema({
  	version: 1,
  	collections: {
  		items,
  	},
  });
  ```

  They may be a little more verbose, but using these wrappers is essential to adding better type validation and other potential features down the line (like typed `any` fields).

  Also, `object` field now accepts default. Object defaults recursively apply nested field defaults if present.

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 4b9e3e4: Make validation exception for legacy @@id key

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 5aa6531: Refresh auth token after expiration

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d2bbec4: Add standalone server CLI command

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- ba63e80: # Summary

  Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning" and more advanced document validation.

  ## Breaking changes

  - Supplying invalid data to documents (according to the schema) is no longer ignored and throws an error.
  - Documents with data which doesn't conform to schema now "prune" invalid data up to the nearest nullable parent or array/map collection. If no prune point is found, the entire document is unavailable.
  - Removed `client.entities.flushPatches`; use `client.entities.flushAllBatches` instead to write all pending changes to storage and sync.

  ## Ambiguous changes

  - `changeDeep` event on documents now fires before `change`
  - Document entities will be garbage collected more reliably now. Storing references to entities outside of a query is not recommended. This behavior requires the `EXPERIMENTAL_weakRefs` flag to be provided to the client initializer.

## 2.0.0-next.0

### Major Changes

- Major rewrite of internals for document storage to improve memory efficiency and data consistency. Introduces "pruning."

## 1.16.2

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 594a03c: Support limited options for string fields in schema and CLI. Adds validation for field values when writing to entities.

### Patch Changes

- e96b252: Collections deleted during migrations now properly delete all related data

## 1.15.5

### Patch Changes

- c686e0f: Another legacy OID hotfix. These things are pesky! Good thing you didn't use this library before May 2023 like I did.

## 1.15.4

### Patch Changes

- 7b3e213: Another legacy OID fix

## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- b0c78bf: ⚠️⚠️ This version requires updating the client and server simultaneously if your app still has legacy OIDs applied to documents. Hopefully that just means me. Does anyone else use Verdant? Anyway, this one removes those legacy OIDs completely so I don't have to worry about them anymore.

  Sorry for not really being semver-conscious here, but I really doubt it affects anyone at this point. You'd have to have been using Verdant before May 26, 2023 for this to matter to you.

## 1.15.3-next.0

## 1.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 633bb00: Another legacy document hotfix

## 1.15.1

### Patch Changes

- f847ec1: Hotfix for old apps using legacy "." formatted OIDs (I gotta migrate those...)

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- a73d381: Rewrites the CLI to fully evaluate schema code, rather than just parsing it as a Typescript AST.

  This allows schemas to import other modules and use any plain TS logic desired to define the final schema.

  Schemas are now bundled and compiled to JS before storing historical copies. The primary schema is now just a pointer to its historical version.

  Migrations now use the new `createMigration` function universally. Migrations are now generated with typings supplied by compiled historical schemas. This should make migration typings more consistent and reliable.

  This change also deprecates fields with `index: true` in favor of a new `indexes` part of a collection schema, which allows direct field pass-through indexes. This consolidates indexes in one place (or, two, with compounds...) and generally makes the typing simpler.

  Deleted a lot of extraneous TS typings.

  Store now only writes index values as top-level fields in the object written to IndexedDB. A snapshot of the object is still provided in a sub-key for future use. This should not be a noticeable change; Verdant had already phased out using the snapshot value in favor of regenerating the view from operations on first load of a document.

## 1.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 81ca170: **Major CLI changes**:

  - The CLI now supports BETA WIP schema workflows. WIP schemas allow you to iterate on schema design locally more easily by copying your database into a temporary branch while you tune the new schema and automatically resetting it when the schema changes.
  - A new CLI command has been added: `verdant-preflight`. Include this in your CI to validate that the current schema is not WIP and ready for deployment before merging and deploying your app. Deploying a WIP schema can cause major problems for users, including data loss.
  - _Migration:_ CLI usage hasn't changed too much, but the workflow has. You'll see when you run it. It's more interactive now; no need to pass additional flags like `--force`.

  Store changes:

  - Store now supports WIP schemas. Supplying a schema with `wip: true` to the StoreDescriptor will initialize a Store with the WIP schema and copy all data from the main databases into temporary fork databases for that schema. You can then test your app with the schema changes before committing to a particular schema shape.
  - WIP schema usage disables sync! This prevents ephemeral data from being stored on the server or passed to other clients. Commit your WIP schema changes into a production schema to re-enable sync.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- e2fe2aa: Bugfix: fix file refs breaking document snapshots

## 1.13.4

### Patch Changes

- fd55c1b: Fix another bug with legacy OIDs

## 1.13.3

### Patch Changes

- 1429bfb: Verdant's client no longer applies changes from _future versions of your schema_ to local data. These changes are still stored and synced, but they will not be reflected in the application. This change is necessary to ensure data integrity with the code that's actually running on your device-- if a future schema changes the shape of the data, but the current client doesn't have that change yet, any data that reflects those changes could be reshaped and violate the expected types in the older code.

  This is technically a breaking change but I would hope nobody is relying on that behavior for some reason.

  I've added an event you can subscribe to on the client called `futureSeen`. If the client notices a change from a future version of the app, it will fire this event. You can subscribe to it to prompt the user to reload the page and get the latest code. Otherwise, in a realtime scenario, they simply won't see the changes the other client is making.

## 1.13.2

- 8d32085: Provide more information for some errors
- 509917c: Major bugfix for legacy object identifier compatibility
- 9edb078: Experimental "downloadRemote" property for file fields, which tries to download and store the file locally for offline use if it's not already on the device.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- a8c8c09: New migration features: shortcut migrations, auto-migration

  ## Shortcut migrations

  You can skip versions when creating migrations, effectively deprecating ranges of versions which you believe no existing clients utilize anymore. This should be done with care!

  You can also use shortcut migrations to create a parallel path from one version to another which skips intermediate versions, reducing the number of migrations new clients have to make to reach the current version.

  See the [docs](https://verdant.dev/docs/local-storage/migrations) for more!

  ## Auto-migration

  Schema migrations now automatically apply simple changes without you having to write any migration logic. Changes supported are:

  - Adding indexes
  - Changing indexes
  - Removing indexes
  - Adding default values to fields or sub-fields
  - Removing fields or sub-fields

  If your schema changes fall within these categories, you don't have to write any migration logic! Just leave the generated file in-place.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- c243009: (internal) remove extranous data from object IDs

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- db43f41: Rename framework to "Verdant"

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9219d68: New queries, including paginated queries.

  # Breaking changes & migration

  You must move any index filters passed to `findOne` or `findAll` into an `index` property in the passed object parameter.

  # What's changed under the hood

  The query system has been revamped to allow for pagination, more intentional caching, and lazy-loading results.

  For the most part, existing `get`, `findOne`, and `findAll` queries work the same as before. However, note that they will not longer eagerly fetch results on creation; you must access `.resolved` or call `.subscribe` to trigger the initial query.

  # New features

  There are two new queries, `getAllInfinite` and `getPage`, which load paginated subsets of the results. You can read about how to use these new queries in the docs.

  This is a major version change for `web` because of the `index` field change, and lazy-loading may cause unforeseen issues in existing codebases. Please upgrade and test functionality carefully. `cli` has also been major-bumped to go along with `web` since it now generates code that relies on `web`'s new functionality.
